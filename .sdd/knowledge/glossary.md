# Terms

- **Application service / service layer:** the existing .NET Framework Web API and repository layer that owns contracts, orchestration, idempotency coordination, and error mapping. It is not a new microservice.
- **Authoritative business rule:** a decision whose result controls committed workflow state. In the baseline, concurrency-sensitive rules are enforced by PostgreSQL routines.
- **Client precheck:** a non-authoritative check used for immediate operator feedback. It must not be relied upon for security or data integrity.
- **Input/presentation validation:** checks needed to create a usable request or explain malformed operator input; this remains a client responsibility for usability and is repeated authoritatively at the API boundary.
- **NativeRules:** the x86 C++ DLL containing duplicated checkout eligibility and tier policy calculations.
- **Observable parity:** equivalent API outcome, database state, audit evidence, and understandable UI behavior for the same scenario, even when responsibility moves.
- **Parent circuit breaker:** `connected.enabled`, evaluated authoritatively by the service and required to be true before any child Connected behavior can activate.
- **Rule mode:** a workflow child selection of `legacy`, `compare`, or `service`; it narrows the parent gate and cannot override a false parent.
- **Compare mode:** side-effect-free shadow evaluation of the service rule with normalized difference telemetry while the Legacy path remains active and exactly one authoritative write occurs.
- **Connected telemetry:** additive, non-authoritative operational evidence for flag evaluation, rule comparison, counts, and durations. It contains hashed cohort/input identities and cannot change or retry a workflow operation.
