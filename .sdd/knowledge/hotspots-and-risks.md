# Hotspots

1. **Checkout client gate:** `Checkout()` fetches member state and prevents the POST when `NativeRules` says the member is ineligible ([main.cpp:349](../../src/DesktopClient/main.cpp#L349)). Removing this changes timing and presentation of rejection even if the authoritative outcome is unchanged.
2. **Duplicated decision table:** tier limits and eligibility exist in both C++ and SQL ([NativeRules.cpp:9](../../src/NativeRules/NativeRules.cpp#L9), [002_routines.sql:3](../../database/002_routines.sql#L3)). The database already supplies limits in `MemberDto`, which can accidentally preserve policy leakage into the client ([Repository.cs:174](../../src/AppServer/Repository.cs#L174)).
3. **Transport coupling:** hard-coded localhost HTTP and absent explicit timeouts mean removing local prechecks increases dependence on a network path that is not yet Connected-ready ([main.cpp:124](../../src/DesktopClient/main.cpp#L124)).
4. **Test coupling:** `NativeRulesTests` protects decision-table parity; removal requires replacement service-level characterization before retirement ([testing-evolution.md:60](../../docs/testing-evolution.md#L60)).
5. **Scope ambiguity:** “all business logic” could mistakenly include required-field checks, confirmation, formatting, and local failure presentation, despite policy assigning immediate operator validation to the client.

# Risks

- A broad rewrite could alter error messages, confirmation flow, or stable API outcomes.
- Moving transactional decisions from stored routines into C# could weaken locking and create dual rule authority.
- Retiring the DLL before service parity tests exist would remove permanent regression evidence.
- Changing client request flow without timeout/retry/idempotency handling could turn clear local rejection into ambiguous network failure.
